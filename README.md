This portfolio is a part of my journey into the fields of Data Analysis and Web Development. It serves as a central hub where you can learn more about my background, view my work, and contact me for potential opportunities. The design is clean and modern, with a focus on accessibility and ease of navigation.

** Modern Aesthetics: ** Utilizes a combination of web-safe fonts and animations to create a visually appealing user experience.
** Easy Navigation: ** A simple and intuitive navigation bar that includes links to my work, contact information, and curriculum.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5:** For structuring the content.
**CSS3:** For styling and layout, including flexbox for responsive design.
**Google Fonts:** For custom typography to enhance the visual appeal.

## Responsive Design
This portfolio is designed to be responsive across a variety of devices. Media queries are used to adjust the layout, font sizes, and image sizes depending on the screen width:

**Small devices (481px - 767px):** The layout adjusts to a single column, with centered content and adjusted font sizes for better readability.
**Medium devices (768px - 1024px):** The layout changes to a two-column design with appropriate spacing between elements.
**Large devices (1025px - 1200px):** Further adjustments are made to the layout, ensuring that all elements are well-positioned and visible.
**Extra large devices (1201px and above):** The layout maintains its structure, with added considerations for larger screen widths to ensure that all navigation items are visible and accessible.
